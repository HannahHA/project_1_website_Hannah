<h1> New Lover? </h1> <p> Troye was spotted with famous Youtuber Connor Franta
in the early weeks/months of 2015. The two were seen getting coffee and lunch
together multiple days a week. Of course fans didnt want to imstantly assume
things and start rumors. Weeks after it was reported that the two were a couple
fans witnessed a fallout between the two. It was rumored that Connor had cheated
with someone else and Troye was upsett, It was believed that when troye wrote
his songs Fools and Talk Me down with his various lyrics such as 'Only fools
fall for you, only fools Only fools do what I do, only fools fall'. </p> <img

<p>Troye was seen leaving Connors house with his bags packed and a taxi was
waiting for  him. Troye flew back to Australia and was seen off social media for
awhile and wasnt spotted with Connor for a long period of time. Early 2016 he
was seen with Tyler Oakley(Youtuber) and the two were showing the same signs as
Connor and Troye. Troye never  confirmed any of the two realtionships. Tyler and
Connor still support Troye and his descions and still attend his L.A. shows.
Troye has yet to be spotted with any of the two recently tho.  </p> <img
