    <h1>Troye Sivan</h1>
  <h2> Getting To Know Him</h2>
    <h3> <p> Troye Sivan is a Australian Youtuber who is now a musician working in the top ten. He was born in Johannesburg, South Africa on June 5th 1995.
      He grew up in Sydney Australia with his younger brother and two parents. He first started off making small skits and videos and then posted covers.
      He started to post covers and attracted a small crowd. When John Green was going to release his movie The Fault In Our Stars he contacted Troye to write a song which was a major hit.
      Troye then started to post more covers turning his channel into more of a music page. In 2013 he was still a very well known but underrated artist. He was the guy you knew but didnt know but you knew that one song.
    The year 2013 was something that was hard for  him since many were now starting to judge who he was. Troye had announced that he was gay in 2014. The following months of that video he released his first EP and Album.
